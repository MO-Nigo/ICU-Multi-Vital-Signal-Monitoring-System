# ICU-Multi-Vital-Signal-Monitoring-System
## PyQt5 Signal Visualization

### Introduction
This project is a PyQt5-based application for visualizing and analyzing signals using two separate plots. It provides a user-friendly interface for loading signals from CSV files, playing/pausing signal visualization, adjusting speed, zooming in/out, moving signals between plots, changing colors, taking snapshots, and generating PDF reports with statistical information.

### Features
- Load and display signals from CSV files.
- Play/pause signal visualization.
- Adjust speed of signal visualization.
- Zoom in/out and reset view.
- Move signals between two plots.
- Change colors of plotted signals.
- Take snapshots of signals and save them as images.
- Generate PDF reports with statistical information for the signals.

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the application.
 ### Usage
1. Launch the application (`main.py`).
2. Use the buttons to load signals, play/pause visualization, adjust speed, zoom in/out, change colors, etc.
3. Interact with the plots to explore the signals visually.
4. Take snapshots of signals for documentation or analysis purposes.
5. Generate PDF reports with statistical information for the loaded signals.

### File Structure
- `main.py`: Main Python script to run the application.
- `Signal_Viewer.ui`: UI file defining the layout of the application's main window.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.
- Other Python files: Additional modules or utilities used in the project.

### Dependencies
- PyQt5: Python bindings for Qt application framework.
- pyqtgraph: Scientific plotting library for PyQt.
- numpy: Numerical computing library.
- matplotlib: Plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- pillow: Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork for image processing tasks.
- fpdf: Library for generating PDF documents.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
